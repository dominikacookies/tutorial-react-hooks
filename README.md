# React Hooks Tutorial

## Concepts covered:

- useEffect hook
- useState hook
- components
- react hook forms
- conditional rendering

## Description

This tutorial introduces the useEffect and useState hooks in a simple application that leverages the [Agify](https://agify.io/) api to predict a person's age based on their name.

The full solution can be found on the main branch but if you fancy tackling the task yourself head over to the 'unsolved-task' branch where you'll find a set of instructions in the README.
