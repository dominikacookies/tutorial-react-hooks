# React Hooks Tutorial

## Concepts covered:

- useEffect hook
- useState hook
- useContext hook
- components
- react hook forms
- conditional rendering

## Description

Part 1 of this tutorial introduces the useEffect and useState hooks in a simple application that leverages the [Agify](https://agify.io/) api to predict a person's age based on their name.
In part 2 we adapt our initial implementation and introduce the concept of context, creating and using our very own provider to set and read information across components in the app.

The full solution for part 1 can be found on the main branch but if you fancy tackling the task yourself head over to the 'unsolved-task' branch where you'll find a set of instructions in the README.
The solution for part 2 (using context to achieve the same result)
can be found on the "solution-using-context" branch.

Happy coding :-)
